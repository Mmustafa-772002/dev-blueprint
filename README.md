> **"The architectural roadmap for my software engineering journey. Documenting progress, fundamental concepts, and technical milestones."**

This repository serves as my central hub for learning, experimentation, and growth. It is a systematic collection of core programming principles and multi-language projects as I build my foundation in software engineering.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Languages
I am currently exploring and building with:

* **Python:** Automation, Data Science, and Backend Logic.
* **JavaScript:** Interactive Web Development and Frontend Frameworks.
* **HTML/CSS:** Structural design and styling.
* **SQL:** Database management and data architecture.
* **Java/C++:** (Optional: Add other languages you plan to learn here).

## 📂 Repository Structure

To keep the "blueprint" organized, I’ve structured the project into specific modules:

* `/fundamentals`: Core concepts (loops, logic, variables) across all languages.
* `/data-structures`: Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, etc.
* `/web-dev`: Frontend and backend web projects.
* `/algorithms`: Solving logic puzzles and optimization problems.
* `/scripts`: Small automation tools and "quality of life" code.

## 🗺️ The Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Current)
- [ ] Master basic syntax in Python and JavaScript.
- [ ] Understand Version Control (Git/GitHub) workflows.
- [ ] Build 5 "mini-projects" (Calculator, To-Do List, etc.).
- [ ] Learn the basics of Responsive Web Design.

### Phase 2: Structural Integrity
- [ ] Dive deep into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- [ ] Study Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
- [ ] Connect a frontend to a simple database.
- [ ] Contribute to an open-source project.

### Phase 3: Advanced Systems
- [ ] Explore Cloud Foundations (AWS/Azure).
- [ ] Learn API design and RESTful principles.
- [ ] Build a full-stack "Capstone" project.
- [ ] Implement Unit Testing and CI/CD pipelines.
